# Common Roles

The Common roles are a collection of my preferred general settings and applications that are needed to manage and use a server. These are used on all servers.

## Tasks

### Basic Installs

Installs a basic array of packages, including ZSH and lf File Manager. 

### Message of The Day

Generates a basic motd configuration and removes some of the adds from the motd configuration. 

### Oh My Zsh
Clones my [linux-dev](https://github.com/hay-kot/linux-dev) repository and sets up my ZSH configuration similar to all other servers based off the repo.

### User
